New codebase for Lineage Retribution www.retrib.net

This is where we will be getting the new content for U.S. clients working, and eventually (hopefully) migrate the ret server over to this code. (epU for now)

I would _not_ run this code.  Chances are it won't compile, if it does, it won't run, and if it runs, it may kill your neighbors cat.  Think about the cats...

This codebase is done separately from l1j-en mainly so I can play and have freedom to break shit.  Once it's stable it'll probably be merged back in to l1j-en.

 **This code base is completely unusable as is.  I'm (very) slowly working on it and playing with it. It does contain my mp regen bug fix though among the source files if anyone wants to grab it and implement it**
